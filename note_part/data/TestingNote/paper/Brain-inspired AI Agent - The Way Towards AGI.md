#### **1. Introduction**

- **Objective**: Develop brain-inspired AI agents to bridge the gap between current AI and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
- **Key Points**:
    - AGI aims to replicate human-like cognitive abilities, including abstraction, planning, and problem-solving.
    - Brain-inspired AI models draw from the structure and connectivity of the human brain to enhance agent capabilities.
    - Large language models (LLMs) are critical but insufficient alone to achieve AGI.

#### **2. The Human Brain as Inspiration**

- **Complexity**: The human brain contains over 86 billion neurons, capable of forming intricate networks essential for intelligence.
- **Cortical Functions**:
    - Different brain regions specialize in distinct functions (e.g., visual processing, memory, decision-making).
    - Functional connectivity mechanisms allow parallel processing and cross-region integration.
- **Frameworks of Cortical Division**:
    1. **Brodmann Areas**: Anatomical and functional categorization of the brain into 52 regions.
    2. **Human Connectome Project**: Advanced mapping of brain regions using multimodal imaging.
    3. **Connectivity Mechanisms**:
        - **Structural Connectivity**: Static neural pathways (e.g., axonal connections).
        - **Functional Connectivity**: Dynamic activation of regions during specific tasks (e.g., Default Mode Network for memory and reflection).

- **Core Features**:
    - Inspired by cortical regions and functional connectivity.
    - Enhances traditional Perception-Planning-Action (PPA) frameworks with brain-like modularity.
- **Key Functional Nodes and Networks**:
    - **Perception**: Visual and auditory processing via cortical networks.
    - **Planning**: Cognitive control in the prefrontal cortex.
    - **Decision-Making**: Logical reasoning in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
    - **Memory**: Interaction between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
    - **Emotion and Reflection**: Regulation via amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex.
    - **Language**: Integration through Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas.
- **Implementation**:
    - Modular design for each function (e.g., CNNs for visual cortex, LLMs for reasoning).
    - Parallel task processing modeled after functional connectivity in the brain.
