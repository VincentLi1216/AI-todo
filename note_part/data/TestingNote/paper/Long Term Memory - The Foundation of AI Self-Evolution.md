1. **Cognitive Accumulation**:
   - Inspired by human learning through interaction with the physical world.
   - Produces fragmented cognitive pieces stored as data for AI training.
2. **Foundation Models**:
   - Constructed from aggregated cognitive data to form "average" models (e.g., LLMs).
   - Limited in handling personalized or long-tail data.
3. **Self-Evolution**:
   - Focuses on creating personalized, adaptive models.
   - Shift from global averages to distributed intelligence architectures capable of dynamic evolution.
