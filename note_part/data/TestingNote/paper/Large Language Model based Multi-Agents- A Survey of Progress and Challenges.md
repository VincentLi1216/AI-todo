#### **2. Core Aspects of Multi-Agent Systems**

1. **Agents-Environment Interface**:

   - **Simulated environments**: e.g., games or software development.
     - Example: Werewolf game simulating roles and actions.
   - **Physical environments**: e.g., multi-robot collaborations for real-world tasks.
     - Example: Robots executing tasks like cleaning or organizing.
   - **No environment**: Scenarios focusing solely on agent interactions, e.g., debates.

2. **Agent Profiling**:

   - **Methods**:
     - Pre-defined: Designed by system developers.
     - Model-generated: Created by LLMs.
     - Data-driven: Based on pre-existing datasets.
   - **Examples**: Roles like players, judges, or coordinators in games or debates.

3. **Agent Communication**:

   - **Paradigms**:
     - Cooperative: Agents collaborate towards shared goals.
     - Debate: Engage in argumentative discussions to reach consensus.
     - Competitive: Pursue conflicting objectives.
   - **Structures**:
     - Centralized: Coordination through a central agent.
     - Decentralized: Peer-to-peer communication.
     - Shared message pool: Efficiency through shared communication space.

4. **Capability Acquisition**:
   - **Feedback sources**:
     - Environment, agent interactions, and human feedback.
   - **Adjustment methods**:
     - Memory: Retain and use information from interactions.
     - Self-evolution: Adapt dynamically based on feedback.
     - Dynamic generation: Create new agents as needed.
