#### **2. Methodology**

1. **CKKS Scheme Overview**:
    
    - Operates on floating-point encrypted vectors.
    - Supports component-wise addition, multiplication, and rotation of ciphertexts.
    - Evaluates non-polynomial functions (e.g., comparison) using polynomial approximations (e.g., Chebyshev polynomials).
2. **Core Algorithms**:
    
    - **Ranking**:
        - Computes ranks in O(1)O(1) depth using homomorphic re-encoding of vectors into row and column matrices.
    - **Order Statistics (e.g., Argmin/Argmax)**:
        - Extracts minimum, maximum, and percentile values through indicator functions on ranks.
    - **Sorting**:
        - Parallelizes order statistics computation for efficient sorting.
3. **Innovations**:
    
    - Homomorphic operations (rotations and masking) allow simultaneous comparisons of all vector elements.
    - Recursive algorithms reduce computational overhead to O(log‚Å°N)O(\log N) for necessary rotations.
